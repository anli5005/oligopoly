        <title>Oligopoly - How to Play</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Welcome to Oligopoly! Oligopoly is a Java re-implementation of Monopoly, with a few minor tweaks here and there.</p>

        <p>In Oligopoly, the goal is to bankrupt (or otherwise eliminate) all your other opponents. You win if you are the last person standing. You have a variety of tools at your disposal: charging rents to players who land on your properties, collecting and upgrading properties in color groups to obtain monopolies, and collecting cards to make strategic plays at the expense of your fellow TAs.</p>

        <p>Oligopoly is intended to be played in a "pass and play" style, where each person takes turns controlling the game. The rules are roughly identical to standard Monopoly (but with a different set of cards and without auctions or trades.) <a href="https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/00009.pdf">You can see the official rules here.</a></p>

        <h1>Navigating the Interface</h1>

        <h2>Saving</h2>
        <p>Games are automatically saved at the start of each turn. When you relaunch the game, your save will automatically be loaded. If you want to discard a save and return to the main menu, click <strong>End Game</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Starting a Game</h2>
        <p>To start a game, choose a board, enter the number of players, and click the <strong>Start</strong> button in the bottom-right corner.</p>
        <p>There are three boards to choose from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard</strong>: The traditional experience, with a variety of properties and chance cards.</li>
            <li><strong>King of the Hill</strong>: Fight over control of a single property. Be sure not to get charged rent!</li>
            <li><strong>Deathmatch</strong>: Abandon the Wharton side entirely and chase your <s>fellow impostors</s> opponents across the board.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you'd like access to debugging features, you can check the <strong>Debug Mode</strong> checkbox at the bottom of the screen. Note that this way of playing the game may lead to issues and is unsupported.</p>

        <h2>Taking Your Turn</h2>
        <p>To start your turn, click <strong>Start Turn</strong>.</p>
        <p>Once you start your turn, you'll see the game board on the left, your <strong>Inventory</strong> on the right, and actions you can take on the bottom.</p>
        <p>To learn more, mortgage, or add/remove buildings from a property, you can click on a property on the board or your <strong>Inventory</strong>. (Note that you must own all properties in a color group before you can build buildings on them, unless you own a <strong>Tourist Trap</strong> card.)</p>
        <p>You can also click on any other item in your <strong>Inventory</strong> to learn more and use it.</p>
        <p>Once you're ready to move, click <strong>Move</strong> on the bottom of the screen. This will roll the dice, which will appear in the center of the board, and move you to your destination. You'll then see a list of actions you can take there at the bottom of the screen. Click on one them to proceed with the game.</p>
        <p>If you land on a chance, community chest, or similar tile, a <strong>Draw card</strong> button will appear. Click it, read the card that appears, and proceed with your turn.</p>
        <p>When your turn ends, pass the mouse to the next player. They can then start and take their turn.</p>

        <h2>Bankruptcy</h2>
        <p>If you become bankrupt (that is, your money is negative,) or if you are otherwise eliminated from the game, you will no longer be able to play for the rest of the game.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> About to go bankrupt? Stave off death by selling buildings and mortgaging properties! (You can do this by clicking on a property you own.)</p>

        <h2>Winning</h2>
        <p>When someone wins, a win message will appear on the board. You can then end the game by clicking on the <strong>End Game</strong> button and start a new one.</p>
